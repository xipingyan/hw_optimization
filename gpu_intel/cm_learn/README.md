# CM (C for Metal)

Intel's C for Metal (CM) is a programming language designed to allow developers to achieve close-to-assembly performance on Intel Processor Graphics (including Arc and Xe GPUs). It's a low-level, explicit SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) programming model that offers fine-grained control over the GPU hardware. <br>


``Key Features:`` <br>
``Explicit SIMD:`` CM exposes the SIMD architecture of Intel GPUs, allowing you to explicitly manage vector and matrix operations.
``Close-to-Metal:`` It provides intrinsics and language constructs that map closely to the GPU's native instruction set (Gen ISA).
``Compatibility:`` CM kernels are compatible with Intel GPU OpenCL runtime and oneAPI Level Zero, allowing them to be launched like OpenCL kernels.
``CPU Emulation:`` There's a "cm-emulation" tool that lets you develop and debug CM kernels on a host CPU, which can be very useful for initial development and testing.

``Data types``<br>
``1:`` explicit SIMD programming model; <br>
``2:`` Vector data typesâ€”vector, matrix, and surface; <br>
``3:`` vector operations on these data types; <br>
``4:`` vector conditions if / else, independently performed for each element of the vector; <br>
``5:`` built-in features for accessing Intel GPU hardware fixed functionality; <br>
